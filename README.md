# Resume automation
This repo shows you how to automate the creation of a resume based on a tex template.

Make sure to enable read-write for github actions so that the workflow can create a tag and release.

# DISCLAIMER
The tex template for the resume is not my creation, I don't remember exactly where from, if you know then please let me know so that I can give proper credit.
